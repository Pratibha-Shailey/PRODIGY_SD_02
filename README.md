# PRODIGY_SD_02
Build a fun and interactive number guessing game in Python that challenges players to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range. 

Description:


Initialization:
The game starts by generating a random number between a predefined range (e.g., 1 to 100) using Python's random module.

Welcome Message:
A friendly welcome message is displayed to greet the player and set the stage for the game.

Player's Turn:
The player is prompted to input their guess, which should be within the specified range.
                
Validation:
The program checks if the input is a valid number. If not, it provides an error message and allows the player to try again.

Guess Comparison:
The player's guess is compared to the randomly generated secret number.
If the guess is too low, the program provides feedback, such as "Too low! Try again."
If the guess is too high, the program provides feedback, such as "Too high! Try again."
If the guess is correct, the game congratulates the player and displays the number of attempts it took to win.

Looping and Repeating:
The game continues in a loop until the player guesses the correct number. The player can make multiple attempts.

End of Game:
When the player guesses correctly, the game displays a victory message along with the number of attempts.

Optional Features:
You can enhance the game by adding features like difficulty levels, a timer, or a scoring system.
You may also consider providing hints or allowing a limited number of attempts.
