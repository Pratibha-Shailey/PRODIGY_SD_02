Below is the code for Number guessing game :



import random

# Generate a random number between 1 and 100
secret_number = random.randint(1, 100)

# Initialize variables
guess = 0
attempts = 0

print("Welcome to the Number Guessing Game!")

while guess != secret_number:
    try:
        # Ask the user for their guess
        guess = int(input("Guess the number (between 1 and 100): "))
        attempts += 1

        # Compare the guess to the secret number
        if guess < secret_number:
            print("Too low! Try again.")
        elif guess > secret_number:
            print("Too high! Try again.")
        else:
            print(f"Congratulations! You guessed the number {secret_number} in {attempts} attempts!")
    except ValueError:
        print("Please enter a valid number.")
